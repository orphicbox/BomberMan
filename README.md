This is a programming test

------------------------------------------------------
Hi IKA Engineer
My name is Mahmood and it proud to me I have a chance to give a test for IKA company.

I'm sorry to start the test too late.
Unfortunately, the glass injured my one-year-old boy's hands and I spent the few days at the hospital and my brain didn't work well.

fortunately, now everything is OK and of course, from the day I received the test, I think about implementation much enough :)

I know that 16 hours to complete all the features is very very short. But I'll try my best.

next step in creating procedural map generator:
It's ideal that can create map by enter world size and block size.  Obviously world boundary elements need too.
